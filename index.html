        <p>A number reflecting your “place” in the order of births in your family. If you were the first, child born, choose 1.  If you have one older sibling and are a twin, then choose 2 if you were born before your twin and 3 if you arrived after.  If this value is complicated in any way for you, choose 1.</p>
        <p>Alex was the second-born, i.e. has an older sibling, so he would put down 2</p>

        <p>Alex was born on December 1 or 12/01. We have the numbers 1, 2, 0, 1. We'll take out any zeros and have 1, 2, 1, which sorted is 112, so he would put down 112</p>
